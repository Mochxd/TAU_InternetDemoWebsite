## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate test automation for The Internet, a sample website containing various web elements and scenarios commonly encountered in web application testing. The automation tests will be written in Java using the Selenium WebDriver and TestNG frameworks. The focus is on creating robust, maintainable, and readable test automation scripts.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. git clone https://github.com/mohamedelshwimy/TAU_TheInternetWebsite.git
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g.,intellij, Eclipse).
4. Install the required dependencies (Selenium WebDriver, TestNG) using Maven. You can do this by right-clicking on the project and selecting "Maven" -> "Update Project."
5. Download the appropriate WebDriver (ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) for your browser and ensure it is in your system's PATH.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- src/main/java: Contains classes and methods for every page.
- src/test/java: Contains test automation scripts for every page on the website.

## Running Tests
- TestNG will execute the test suite, and you can monitor the progress in your IDE's console.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this README file serves as a comprehensive guide to the test automation project for The Internet, following the guidelines from the Test Automation Course by Angie Jones. By adhering to the prerequisites, project overview, and getting started instructions outlined in this document, you can quickly set up and run automated tests for a variety of scenarios on the website.
